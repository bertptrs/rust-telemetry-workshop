//! # Ergonomics
//!
//! Before I stated that we shouldn't treat each function as its own unit of work—it's way
//! too verbose and it leads to a lot of noise in the logs.
//! Nonetheless, it is often the case that a unit of work maps to **a certain** function. The work
//! starts when that function is invoked and ends when it returns. That was indeed the case in the
//! previous exercise.
//!
//! When it happens, we can use the `instrument` macro to avoid having to manually create a span
//! inside the function body.
//!
//! # Exercise
//!
//! Read the `instrument` macro documentation: https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/attr.instrument.html
//! Then use it to complete the same exercise as before, instead of manually creating and entering
//! spans.
//!
//! Tip: you can use `Span::current()` to get a reference to the current span from inside
//! the function body.
